Making money as a developer is easy when you pick a web development framework that is mature, easy to use and has large community support. Ruby on Rails stands out to be one of the highest paying technologies in web development as per StackOverflow survey of 2021.  This is a good reason to start learning Ruby on Rails Now!

Advantages of Ruby on Rails
1.	Full stack framework: Web development has both the front end and backend. Front deals with the user interaction, whatever is displayed on the browser. Backend is mainly data processing and communication with other applications. Rails supports all this through the Model View Controller architecture. 
2.	Model View Controller (MVC): Model delas with the database and processes user’s requests, the view displays the results to the user and forward requests from the user to the Controller which acts as an intermediary between the Model and View.
3.	Easy to get started: with just a computer and internet access, Ruby on Rails. documentation provides direct steps to building your first application. rubyonrails.org
4.	Large community support: at early stages of learning its’s common getting stuck and things not working out as you expect, every master was once a beginner. Almost all problems that I encountered when starting Rails were solved through “Googling it technique” StackOverflow leading as the site to my solutions. Asking and posting questions here is free.
5.	Knowledge and concepts acquired can be applied when learning other frameworks. MVC is common to other web development frameworks like Django-Python and PHP-Laravel.  You can be productive and work as a developer with other teams easily. More Cash, you see!
6.	Security is highly considered, all data should be secure, Rails is good at this, it has Gems that support standardized authentications and authorization like Bcrypt gem 
7.	Used by big tech companies, just to mention a few GitHub, Shopify, Airbnb, Basecamp, Crunchbase, Dribble and Bloomberg.
