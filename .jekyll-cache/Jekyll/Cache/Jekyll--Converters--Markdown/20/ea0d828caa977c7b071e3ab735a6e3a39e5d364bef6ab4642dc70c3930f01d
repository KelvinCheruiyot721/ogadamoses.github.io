Backend is mainly data processing and communication with other applications. Rails supports all this through the Model View Controller architecture.</li>

  <li>Large community support: at early stages of learning its‚Äôs common getting stuck and things not working out as you expect, every master was once a beginner. Almost all problems that I encountered when starting Rails were solved through ‚ÄúGoogling it technique‚Äù StackOverflow leading as the site to my solutions. Asking and posting questions here is free.</li>
  <li>Knowledge and concepts acquired can be applied when learning other frameworks. MVC is common to other web development frameworks like Django-Python and PHP-Laravel.  You can be productive and work as a developer with other teams easily. More Cash, you see!</li>
  <li>Security is highly considered, all data should be secure, Rails is good at this, it has Gems that support standardized authentications and authorization like Bcrypt gem</li>
