<p>Learning how to code requires patience and proper planning. There are a lot of new technologies that hits the market daily. Focusing on one at a time is the best trick to overcome this curiosity. That doesn’t mean you put aside consistency. Actually I stabilized on my learning culture within four months, it may be different for you. Considering my 8 to 5 daily job and lots of travels, I decided to give two hours every morning for proper coding studies. I had jumped over many books covering different programming languages but when the time was right I decided to pick one and it worked fine. I spent about one year moving from point to point, it’s not a waste of time though. Many small concepts that i accrued within that period still helps me a lot. So this what i did to solve my own problem.</p>

<p>Convinced myself that i have many years to be perfect and reach at senior level.
Focused on frontend web development. HTML/CSS and JavaScript. each independently and in sequence.
Picked on a frontend framework. React JS
Basics of code versioning and sharing, Git GitHub
Worked on small pet projects.
Picked on Ruby
Advanced to Ruby on Rails.
Still at step 7 but trust me i have hit over 100 contributions on GitHub. Small number ,yes but that’s a great achievement on my side.
I didn’t say you must do all this but just check and try out what works best for you.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time in reading and commenting.</p>
