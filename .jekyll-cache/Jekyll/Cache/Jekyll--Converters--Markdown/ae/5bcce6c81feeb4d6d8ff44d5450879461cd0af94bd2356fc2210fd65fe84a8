I",<p>Learning how to code requires patience and proper planning. There are a lot of new technologies that hits the market daily. Focusing on one at a time is the best trick to overcome this curiosity. That doesn’t mean you put aside consistency. Actually I stabilized on my learning culture within four months, it may be different for you. Considering my 8 to 5 daily job and lots of travels, I decided to give two hours every morning for proper coding studies. I had jumped over many books covering different programming languages but when the time was right I decided to pick one and it worked fine. I spent about one year moving from point to point, it’s not a waste of time though. Many small concepts that i accrued within that period still helps me a lot. So this what i did to solve my own problem.</p>
